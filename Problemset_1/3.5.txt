#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
int dole=2;

int bob=20;

int accumulator = 0;

while (true)
 {
 if(dole==0) break ;
 accumulator += (( dole % 2 == 1) ? bob : 0);
 dole /= 2;
 bob *= 2;
 }
 cout << accumulator << "\n";
 
}
The program above finds the square of the number if both 
dole and bob are same we can say that we are multiplying
bob, dole times so say bob is 20 and dole is 2 it will be:
20*2=40(I used the computer to understand the program)

Question # 2

# define O 1 // That ’s an oh , not a zero
2 int main ()
3 {
4 return O;
}
in this program we are defining O as equal to 1 
and then we are returning O so on the screen there will be
nothing but the program will return 1 which is the value of
O and the program exits with code 1(I didn't used a computer).

Question # 3

// N is a nonnegative integer
2 double acc = 0;
3 for(int i = 1; i <= N; ++i)
4 {
5 double term = (1.0/ i);
6 acc += term * term ;
7 for (int j = 1; j < i; ++j)
8 {
9 acc *= -1;
10 }
11 }
12 cout << acc << "\n";
In this program the first for loop adds 1/i² to acc
until the condition i<=N becomes false and the second for loop
checks for if the value of i is even or odd if its even it flips
the sign if odd it does nothing and then the program prints acc(I didn't used a computer).
